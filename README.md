# Microservices.README


**MICROSERVICES** 
- a style where independent deployable services colloborate to form a application or software system.

**MONOLITH**
- a software application that has all code in a "single"codebase which contains a "single" proccess that runs on a "single" host and uses a "single" database.

**Conflicts of Monoliths** 
- Risky when changing code/must update entire application/edit mulitple services 
- Requires numerous downtime
 
**Benefits of Microservices**
- Small enough to restart
- Able to adapt to new technology
- You can deploy individual rather doing it on one go

**Conflicts of Monoliths**
- Complex understanding and can suffer from performance issues if not taken care you will find it hard
- Will need to automate deployment

**Conflicts of Microservices**
- Will need to automate the process
- A single operation requires communication between numerous services
- Many MORE deployments










"Just because your architecture type is on services doesn't mean your using microservices".
